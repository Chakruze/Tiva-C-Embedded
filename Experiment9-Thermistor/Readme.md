# Experiment9-Thermistor

## Overview
This is a short experiment that tests out an NTC thermistor temperature sensor.  The thermistor is placed in series with a 10K resistor, and an ADC input is placed at the divider.  Using a temperature/resistance table (one table for Fahrenheit and another for Celsius) from the vendor, the ADC input is mapped to the temperature using a binary search.  The temperature values are then written to the UART and displayed on the PC terminal.
